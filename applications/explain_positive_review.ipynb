      "LLM's review:  **Review of Submission: \"LLM Agents for Bargaining with Utility-based Feedback\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The paper presents a significant advancement in the field of negotiation and bargaining using large language models (LLMs). The authors, Jihwan Oh et al., introduce a novel framework that addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks in capturing the complexities of real-world bargaining scenarios. Their contributions include the creation of the BARGAINARENA dataset, the development of a human-aligned evaluation metric (HAMBA), and an innovative in-context learning approach that leverages utility-based feedback to enhance LLM negotiation strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strengths:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Innovative Dataset Creation:**\n",
      "   The introduction of BARGAINARENA is a remarkable contribution to the field. By incorporating six intricate market scenarios that reflect real-world complexities—such as deceptive practices and monopolistic conditions—the authors provide a robust platform for evaluating LLM performance in negotiation tasks. This dataset fills a critical gap in existing research, which often relies on overly simplistic benchmarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Human-Aligned Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
      "   The development of the HAMBA metric is a noteworthy advancement. By grounding the evaluation in economic theory and incorporating factors such as consumer surplus, negotiation power, and acquisition ratio, the authors ensure that the assessment of LLMs aligns closely with human preferences. This approach not only enhances the evaluation process but also promotes the development of more effective negotiation strategies in LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Structured Feedback Mechanism:**\n",
      "   The proposed in-context learning approach, which utilizes utility-based feedback, is a significant methodological innovation. By enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining strategies based on structured feedback, the authors demonstrate a clear pathway for improving LLM performance in negotiation tasks. The empirical results showing substantial improvements in negotiation outcomes further validate the effectiveness of this approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:**\n",
      "   The authors provide a thorough experimental evaluation of their framework, demonstrating its effectiveness across various LLMs, including GPT and Gemini series models. The results indicate that the proposed methods lead to significant enhancements in negotiation performance, showcasing the practical applicability of their contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Relevance and Impact:**\n",
      "   The work addresses a pressing need in the AI community for more sophisticated negotiation capabilities in LLMs. Given the increasing deployment of AI in real-world applications, the insights gained from this research have the potential to influence future developments in autonomous agents and negotiation systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "In conclusion, the paper \"LLM Agents for Bargaining with Utility-based Feedback\" makes impactful contributions to the fields of natural language processing and AI-driven negotiation. The innovative dataset, human-aligned evaluation metrics, and structured feedback mechanisms represent significant advancements that will benefit both researchers and practitioners. The methodological rigor and empirical validation presented in the paper further strengthen its case for acceptance. I strongly recommend that this paper be accepted for presentation at the conference, as it offers valuable insights and tools that will advance the understanding and capabilities of LLMs in complex negotiation scenarios.\n"
